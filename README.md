## Picturesque 

PICTURESQUE is a Ruby on Rails project that was made as part of module 3 with Flatiron School.
Inspired by Instagram. Picturesque aims to capture that appeal to provide users more interactability 
through comments instead of likes/follows. Posts are updated in order of creation for immediate viewing.

Users must first sign up for an account using their name, email, and a chosen password. Registered users may change their login credentials through the "Account" tab on the navigation bar. Carrierwave gem is used for storing photos. Once a photo is uploaded, the user can give the photo a caption. Users have their own profile page with a profile-picture feature. Users can also view other uploads in the Posts path. Users cannot edit content other than their own.

Big thank you to my instructor (Morgan), cohort-mates (BJ & Ben), and friend (Nick) for making this project possible!
